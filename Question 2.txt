The purpose of using comment in HTML document is as follows:
It is used to include explanation of code so that it would be easy to edit the source code later whenever required.
Comments do not get rendered hence not displayed on the web browser.
It is used to hide a piece of code instead of deleting it but it can be viewed in source code.
Comment is written inside <!-- -- >.
